        <p>Here are the rules of the game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>After a player sets their name for the game, they are shown the game screen.</li>
            <li>Each player will be dealt 2 cards along with the card the dealer drew. All are initially face down.</li>
            <li>The game begins when 4 players connect to the server, at which point the cards are flipped.</li>
            <li>Each player must then select one of their 2 cards to play. The objective is to beat the dealer's card by playing a card of greater value to get a point while also keeping in mind the cards the other players might play as those must also be beaten in order to win more points.</li>
            <li>Each round consists of 2 turns in which players must play one card for each turn.</li>
            <li>The game continues until the dealer runs out of cards to deal to all of the players. At this point, the points are tallied and a winner announced.</li>
        </ul>
